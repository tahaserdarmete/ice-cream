## **Code Implementation Guidelines**

### **Structure & Readability**

- Use **early returns** wherever they improve clarity.
- Use **const** for all functions (e.g., `const toggle = () => {}`).
- Use **descriptive variable and function names**.
- Event handlers must start with **handle** (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`).

### **Styling Rules**

- **Use TailwindCSS classes for all styling**.
- No CSS files, no inline styles (unless absolutely required), no other styling systems.

### **Class Handling**

- Use `class:` syntax instead of ternary operators when conditionally applying classes.

### **Accessibility**

Interactive elements must include:

- `tabIndex="0"`
- `aria-label`
- `onClick`
- `onKeyDown`
- Any additional needed accessibility attributes
